# Applying the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) in a Payment Service

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a cornerstone of clean architecture. It ensures that high-level modules are independent of low-level details by relying on abstractions. This example demonstrates how DIP enables flexibility and scalability in a payment processing system.

## **Does the Code Follow DIP?**

Yes, the code adheres to DIP principles by ensuring:
- The high-level `PaymentService` interacts only with interfaces or protocols.
- It avoids direct dependencies on low-level implementations like payment processors, validators, or notifiers.

---

## **How Can the Code Be Improved?**

### **Current Limitation**
High-level classes still instantiate low-level dependencies, such as:
- Validators.
- The logger.

### **Recommended Solution**
- Replace default factories with **external dependency injection**.
- Ensure all dependencies are provided from outside, making the high-level module completely independent of low-level implementations.

## **How Is the Payment Service Instantiated?**

The system showcases a clean instantiation process:
1. Create the necessary dependencies:
   - Stripe processor (reused for refunds and recurring payments).
   - Validators for customers and payments.
   - Email notifier.
   - Logger.
   
2. Pass these dependencies into the `PaymentService`.

This approach ensures:
- Minimal coupling between the `PaymentService` and low-level details.
- Easy substitution of dependencies for different processors or notifiers.

## **Benefits of Dependency Injection**

Dependency injection enhances flexibility and maintainability:
- **Easily Switch Implementations**:  
   Example: Replace Stripe with another payment processor or swap the email notifier with an SMS notifier. Only the injected instances need adjustment; the core service remains untouched.

- **Decoupled Architecture**:  
   High-level modules remain isolated from implementation details, fostering scalability and reducing the risk of breaking existing functionalities.

By adhering to DIP and leveraging dependency injection, the payment service achieves a modular, flexible, and maintainable architecture. This approach simplifies integrating new features and adapting to changing requirements without compromising stability.
